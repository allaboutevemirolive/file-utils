### Emphasis on Scripting Style

Within this repository, I place a strong emphasis on the *scripting style* in coding, as it has proven to be *immensely advantageous* for my work. The use of scripting allows for *efficient automation* of tasks such as:

- Creating bulk folders
- Deleting files
- Performing various other operations

Traditionally, these tasks were accomplished using scripting languages like bash. However, with the remarkable advancements in AI and the ever-expanding possibilities in the technological landscape, almost any programming language can now be utilized as a scripting language.

### Focus on Rust Programming Language

In this particular repository, I have chosen to focus primarily on developing file utility scripts using the **Rust programming language**. Rust's unique features make it an excellent choice for creating *reliable and efficient file manipulation tools*. Some of Rust's notable qualities include:

- **Memory safety**: Ensuring secure handling of memory
- **Performance**: Delivering high-speed execution
- **Expressive syntax**: Allowing for clear and concise code

By leveraging Rust's capabilities, I aim to deliver *robust and high-performance file utilities* that can be utilized across different platforms and scenarios.
