I have a nested folder containing some ".rs" files, which are rust files. 

I don't know where the ".rs" file is located, but I know I want to remove all ".rs". 

Can you generate rust code that will delete files with ".rs" in nested folders?

Certainly! Here's an example of Rust code that uses the `std::fs` module to recursively search for and delete all files with the ".rs" extension in a given directory and its subdirectories:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

fn delete_files_with_extension(dir: &Path, extension: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    if dir.is_dir() {
        for entry in fs::read_dir(dir)? {
            let entry = entry?;
            let path = entry.path();

            if path.is_dir() {
                delete_files_with_extension(&path, extension)?;
            } else if let Some(file_name) = path.file_name() {
                if let Some(ext) = file_name.to_str().and_then(|name| name.split('.').last()) {
                    if ext == extension {
                        fs::remove_file(&path)?;
                        println!("Deleted file: {:?}", path);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let directory = std::env::current_dir().expect("Failed to get current directory");

    if let Err(err) = delete_files_with_extension(&directory, "rs") {
        eprintln!("Error deleting files: {}", err);
    }
}
```

This code defines a recursive function `delete_files_with_extension` that takes a directory path and an extension as input. It iterates over the entries in the directory and performs the following checks:

1. If the entry is a directory, it recursively calls `delete_files_with_extension` with the subdirectory path.
2. If the entry is a file, it checks if the file has the desired extension. If so, it deletes the file using `fs::remove_file`.
3. Any deleted files are printed to the console.

In the `main` function, it retrieves the current directory using `std::env::current_dir` and calls `delete_files_with_extension` with the directory and the "rs" extension. Any errors encountered during the process are printed to the console.

Please make sure to exercise caution when running this code, as it permanently deletes files from your system.
